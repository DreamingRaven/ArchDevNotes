# ArchDevNotes
Personal reference guide to installing certain development tools on arch linux

Installed: vulkan-icd-loader, nvidia, vulkan-headers, (\*vulkan-validation-layers).

\*vulkan-validation-layers is optional, but neccessary for debugging, since little default debugging is availiable in Vulkan by default.

Please see CMakeLists.txt and main.cpp (in this files directory) for example usage.
